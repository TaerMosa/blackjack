noob-a-thon-blackjack
=====================

The testing framework for blackjack. Noob-a-thon 2012-06. Special thanks to gregbayer (Backend Lead @ Pulse) here on github.

I've updated to project to include the answers. I realized after that this was a mistake (I should have used a different branch for the answers and the exercise). If you download the project you can remove the answers from your code by deleting the com.noobathon.blackjack package.
